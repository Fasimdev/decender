<h2>Learn pumping and counter-pumping</h2>
<p>Pumping and counter-pumping are skills you will need to learn if youâ€™re going to get anywhere in the game.</p>
<p>You can use counter-pumping to soften your landing and reduce the amount of time spent in the air. It is achieved through pressing down D (or holding the right joystick up on the Xbox One controller) before hitting a ramp.</p>
<p>Pumping, on the other hand, makes you stick to the ground and gives you a speed boost on ramps to achieve greater height. You can pump by keeping hold of S (or pushing the right joystick down) and then releasing it at the top of the ramp.<p>
<p>Used correctly, these two techniques will make some of the bonus objectives far easier to complete and will help you to master the other obstacles in your way.</p>

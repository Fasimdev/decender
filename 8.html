<h2>Play at your own speed</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson you can learn from playing Descenders is to go at your own pace. The game allows for a bunch of different play styles and lets players skip out on certain obstacles by simply going around them. If you’re having a hard time with one of the stunt jumps, then miss it out. You won’t be punished for it, but you will lose the chance to earn some additional reputation.</p>
<p>This works the other way too. If you’re the daring type, you may want to do the reverse and take more risks. If this applies, then you can go off course and perform tricks like wheelies and stoppies to earn more points.</p>
<p>You can express this desire in the maps you choose, too. Each map has three bars on the stage select menu, which indicates the number of stunts, its steepness, and how curvy it is. While you will always start on a fairly average map, from there you can then tailor your selections to how you want to play. Prefer stunts? Then look for a map with a longer bar stunt bar. Like to go fast? Then pay attention to the steepness of every map available before you choose.</p>

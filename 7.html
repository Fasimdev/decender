<h2>Bigger bails equal more points lost</h2>
<p>Every time you bail you will have points deducted from your overall reputation. The amount will depend on the intensity of the crash. If you’re going slower, then you will be penalised less than if you were careering down a hill at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>Bear this in mind while you play. Whenever you feel like you’re losing control of the bike, try to reduce your speed. This will prevent you from losing all your hard-earned points on a stage by ploughing into a cactus or a tent.</p>

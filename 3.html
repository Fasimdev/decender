<h2>Mess around with the camera</h2>
<p>There are a number of camera perspectives to choose from in-game. Some of these make it much harder, such as the first-person angle, while others expand the field of vision letting you take in more of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Experiment with the different angles and settle on the one that is right for you. Maybe you prefer the standard camera, or maybe you want a more overhead view to get a better sense of the environment.</p>

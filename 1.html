<p>Descenders has been out of Early Access on Steam for two months now, and the positive consensus on this procedural extreme downhill freeriding cycling game has led to a surge in new players after the Steam Summer Sale.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising, to be honest, as the game is actually a lot of fun, and I’ve found myself playing it quite a lot over the weekends as you can easily drop in for a quick ride before moving onto something else. There’s not much pressure on the player, and you can just as easily chill out in the interactive lobby with other players and ride and do tricks, or opt for the real stuff in career mode and others.</p>
<p>However, there is a bit of a steep – pun very much intended – learning curve here, as while Descenders is quite easy to pick up, some players might find themselves getting a bit frustrated over it, which may end in players just quitting altogether. Before you hit that refund button, though, don’t give up just yet – I was once in your place, and after getting to know some of the mechanics more through a lot of playing, I can certainly say it’s worth the effort.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in the same predicament, then here are some tips and tricks that should help out a beginner or everyone having trouble with Descenders.</p>
<p>Descenders prides itself as a procedurally generated extreme downhill freeriding game, and to the developers’ merit, it works quite well. Sure, at the start there’s only four biomes to work towards, but you see a significant change in how the curvature, steepness and overall danger of the course is depending on the rating on the map (more on this later).</P>
<p>It’s understandable then that some players might find themselves turned off from the challenging task of anticipating the jumps and obstacles as they happen, but it’s actually quite a bit easier to read it than what they were expecting. The first important tip for this is to always look beyond what’s in front of you. Take Highlands, for example – if there are patches of trees ahead on the horizon, then it’s more than likely that you’ll find yourself in the midst of them soon, which means that you have to steady your bike to avoid getting caught up in them.</p>
<p>Sudden steep sections are harder to anticipate, but you can usually react to it as it happens. In any case, building up too much speed when there’s a big jump ahead is just as dangerous as building up too little, as you might find that you won’t be able to land that jump properly.</p>
<p>Straying off the beaten path could be an easier way out</P>

<p>What I loved most about Descenders is that while it provides you with a path to ride on, the environment for the most part allows you to take any way you please – even off-road. True enough, one of the sponsors encourages this kind of riding, and it’s as exciting as it is dangerous.</p>

<h2>Complete bonus objectives</h2>
<p>Every time you pick a track to race on, you are given an additional objective. This can include not letting go of the acceleration, doing specific tricks, or staying in the air for a particular length of time. These activities aren’t required to move on to the next race, but they reward you with extra health alongside points towards your overall reputation. Try to complete them whenever possible. It will help make up for any points you lose elsewhere from bailing.<p>
<p>That being said, if you’re having trouble completing one, don’t dwell on it. Move on, and then attempt the next objective instead.</p>

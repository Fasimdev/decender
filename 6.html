<h2>Attack mode</h2>
<p>Attack mode is a feature that lets you have better control over your bike at high speeds. You can activate it in a race by holding down S and letting go of the acceleration.</p>
<p>This will make your avatar lean over the handlebars and be able to turn the bike much more sharply. This is especially useful on bonus objectives that require you to hit a certain speed and will often prevent you from crashing head first into rocks or trees scattered around the stag</p>
